# Hello!!
## What's this SHIT about

So I will use this place to dump all the codes and maybe some theory which I might find interesting to share. There will be tons of places I must 
have referred to during the projects and defintely those being my teacher would be far better than what I could ever explain. So, I would add those 
links. 

## What a reader can expect.
This site won't contain everything about robotics. But yeah I will try to learn all the aspects out there.
Starting from arduino programming to Geometric Control, starting from some crude algos to deep learning shit.

Caution: I might at times also add my physics notes. Oh yeah I completed my masters in Theoretical Physics and prior to that I obtained a Bachelor's 
in Systems Engineering from IITJ. It was during my undergrduation I did a lot of tinkering. I have decided to go back to that tinkering mode.
Learning anything and everything but this time I have decided to share watever I learn on this platform. I hope people find it useful in some way or
the other.
One reason I am starting to write everything down is I want reach out people and
